# ATP Match Predictions Using Tree-based Methods
This GitHub page contains the code for the final paper of the course Machine Learning (EBC4257), focusing on using tree-based methods (DT, boosting, bagging, RF) for tennis match prediction. The original dataset was created and maintained by Jeff Sackmann (retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis), containing information about ATP singles matches spanning from 1968 until 2022. More specifically, both the original dataset ("atp_matches_till_2022.csv"), as well as the cleaned dataset used for the analysis in this paper ("reg_data1_1991NEW.csv") are included.
